Methods
To get the data, I first needed 
- Python3
- JS
- What stats I got and why each stat is important

Execution
(code snippet)
- one error that I was getting was copied code disappearing after execution and/or not being changed the way that I wanted it to be. This was due to a shallow copy being created which meant whenever data was changed within on quarter, it was changed in another quarter due to the way it was copied.
