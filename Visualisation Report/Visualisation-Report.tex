\section*{Introduction}
Hi, my name is Natalie Hong and I am a third year Software Engineering Student. I have chosen to take this course as I enjoy visualising data and am super interested in the graphics section of the course as I was able to brush over it in highschool, but was never able to further my knowledge in it.
I also am heavily involved in a certain gaming community which has serves as the main factor of choice for my visualization project decision.
