\section{Introduction}
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, a game for the Nintendo Switch is an immensely popular game with an amazing community nationwide. This report was created with the aims of giving the Australian community a better insight into character changes and skill gaps between each quarter of 2019 and differences between rising skill levels of states. This insight will be properly visualised through multiple data graphs including that of univariate, bivariate and multivariate representations.


\section{The Data Set}
Hello and welcome to my report about data visualisation. My name is Natalie and I am a third year Software Engineering student and I'm enjoying this course so far.
\

The data set I have chosen is that of character usage, skill gain and played tournaments revolving around that of a local gaming community in Australia. The way I have chosen to present this data set is through that of local JavaScript which calls the Google Chart library. This means that I will be able to deploy a live website showing this data for later viewing and later analysis. 
\

As data is always changing in database I was using, I decided to only pull data from last year (2019) to give a more accurate representation of data and split them into each quarter (every 3 months). Since I am an active player within this community, I believe that releasing this data publically will allow for a more insightful look into the past and how the metagame (accepted norm) of the community has changed.
\

I hope that you will find this interesting even if you don't play games.

\section{Techniques, Methods and Execution}
In this section, I will talk about my approach to the data collection; how I handled the data and how I displayed the data in web form.
\subsection{Techniques - The Approach to the Data}
The data that I was trying to access was that of a public API that I could easily access through Python. I preferenced m

The data was stored in JSON form which meant that I had to iterate through various levels of data to get the data that I wanted. 

Since I was on a mac, I had to create a virtual environment to be able to access the API. Once I set up this environment, I created a Python script then called the API using a variety of similar functions to the code block below.

\begin{lstlisting}    
headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json',
           'X-ApiKey': '6PG3OWV9UCVFZNTXQJKR'}

# ID being the character ID
def character_matches(id):
    url = 'https://api.ausmash.com.au/characters/{}/matches'.format(id)
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    
    content = json.loads(response.content)
    # JSON file of the content received
    return content

\end{lstlisting}

How I was able to sort this data into a more readable and interactable form can be seen in the next section.

\href{https://api.ausmash.com.au/swagger/ui/index#/}{(Click for API Documentation)}

\subsection{Methods - How I Handled the Data}
Before working towards getting my data, I had decided that I wanted to pull elo gain (skill gain, it will be called elo throughout the report), the unique amount of players who played each character and the amount of tournaments entered for the specific character. Each character's data would then be sorted into states which would then further be stored into quarters (every 3 months e.g. Q1 is from January 1st 2019 to March 31st 2019).

To do this, I iterated through every single character's logged matches and got each unique player, their state and the won elo if the player won the match. I would also get the date and would match the date to the associated quarter. Once this was done, I then added their data to a large dictionary data structure.

Once the data was fully sorted, I wrote the contents of the dictionary into a JSON file which was then to be used for my JavaScript file which would display the data using Google Charts. This JavaScript usage will be explained in the next section.

\subsection{Execution - Displaying the Data}
Using \href{https://developers.google.com/chart}{Google Charts} I was able to create various suitable graphs for my collected data using native JavaScript. The chosen graphs that were used for my data visualisation were that of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Bar Charts
	\item Bubble Charts
	\item Line/Area Charts
	\item Scatter Plots (using the same library as Bubble Charts)
	\item Step Graphs
\end{itemize}

Order of iteration through my chosen data would change depending on which graph I had chosen and and what I wanted to display. This lead to many different variances of the same code which would each have different outcomes. For example, for some code I would need to iterate through quarters rather than the states. When running the script for my data, I also made sure to check the player's state of origin rather than where they competed to account for interstate tournaments and visits. 

When I wanted to create the specified chart, I would create an array to hold the data in it called 'overallData'. This array would then hold more arrays which would correspond to different datapoints and axis that I wanted to display depending on the chart that I had chosen. 

A demonstration of the JavaScript code used to display the chart can be seen below.

\begin{lstlisting}    
    function drawChart() {
		var data = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable(
			overallData
		);
		
		var options = {
			title: chartTitle,
			width: 1800,
			height: 800,
			vAxis: {
				title: 'Y axis name'
			},
			hAxis: {
				title: 'X axis name'
			}
		};
									
		var chart = new google.visualization.ChartType(document.getElementById("chart-div"));
		chart.draw(view, options);
	}
\end{lstlisting}

Using similar code blocks to this, I was able to create the following graphs which will be analysed in the next section.

\section{Data Analysis}
Before beginning my data analysis, I decided to group my data into little subsections. These being:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Player and Match Data}
	\item{Character Data}
	\item{Elo Data}
	\item{Combined Data}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Player and Match Data Analysis}
\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{/playerMatchGraphs/RegisteredPeople.png}}
	\caption{The Total Amount of Registered Players in Each State (2019)}
	\label{fig:figure1}
\end{figure}
The first graph that I wanted to display was that of unique players that had participated within tournaments for each state. From this graph, it is possible to see that Victoria (VIC) had the most registered players in 2019 while Tasmania (TAS) and International (INT) players have the smallest registered players, this may be due to the populus size of TAS and the lack of international competitors entering Australian tournaments. 

It's worth noting that New South Wales (NSW) should have a much larger registered playerbase due to its large population compared to all the other states. This however, does not seem to be the case, making it an outlier in the dataset. This could be due to a lack of tournaments held per week which can lead to a struggle in encouraging new players to join the gaming scene.

\newpage

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{/playerMatchGraphs/stepChart.png}}
	\caption{Step Graph Representing The Amount of Matches Played in Each State (2019)}
	\label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure}
Figure 2 shows the amount of matches that were played each quarter (Q) for each state. From the analysis of Figure 1, it is clear that the amount of players in a state can impact the total amount of matches played each quarter. As per Figure 1, VIC remains the state with the most amount of matches played across the year due to their large registered playerbase. 

Something not seen within Figure 1 that is seen in that of Figure 2 is that in the first quarter, NSW and QLD had a similar amount of matches played. This may have been due to the game's recent release as it came out in December which would've have brought many new players to start the year off with but as time went on, NSW players started to drop out of the scene and stop playing which resulted in less matches played in NSW for the rest of the year as the quarters following Q1 resulted in less matches played. One reason for NSW to have such a drop off in player base may be due to its community not being able to engage with new players properly unlike that of VIC and QLD's older communities which have been around since early 2010's, allowing them to be more experienced with new players.

It is also noticeable that TAS has almost no matches played in every quarter, each being around 27 for most of them which was also evident in Figure 1.

Since matches played isn't too much of a good measure of constant activity within a community. I decided to divide the total amount of matches by the players within each quarter to see if any trend could be found.
